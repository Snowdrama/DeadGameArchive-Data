      "notes": "Anthem is noteable for being held up as an example of the decline of 'Live Service' gaming. The game was almost universally panned on release for it's 'looter-shooter' style gampleay being extremely grindy, and having a weak story, however it's visuals, flight gamplay, and shooting gameplay itself were considered fun on their own. While Anthem reached at least 5m units sold, it still failed to meet EA's sales expectations. Being an always online live service game there is no offline mode, and no way to play now that the servers are shut down.",

      "notes": "The game was generally considered a success, and the game even spawned a sequel, however the controversy came in 2024 when the decision to shut down the servers for the game came as a shock to the community when they could no longer even play the Single Player campaign due to it being an always online game with no offline mode. The Crew's shutdown is the event that kickstarted the Stop Killing Games campaign.",

The game did not reach their $60k goal, and On June 14, 2019 they announced that they were canceling the Kickstarter but the game was being added to Steam. The game would eventually release on July 26th 2019. By September 24, 2019 it was announced that Sauropod was laying off most of it's staff, around 20 people. Former employees noted mismanagment during the development of Mirador including going through several designers, and the team being made of mostly engineers. On October 3rd an official post was made noting that the studio was not closing, and that they'd continue to try and support the games as much as possible. As of 2026 the Sauropod website is no longer active.",

      "notes": "Wildstar was one of the most hyped new MMOs after the rise of World of Warcraft, and was a contender to be one of the 'WoW Killers' that would potentially take a chunk of WoW's userbase. However even with a positive reception, the game didn't end up taking off and a year after launch in 2015 it was announced the game would go free to play. In 2016 they shut down PvP and merged the remaining players into 2 PvE servers. Ultimately NCSoft closed Carbine Studios in mid 2018 with the WildStar servers to shut down shortly after in November the same year. Being an MMO there's no official way to experience the game now that the servers are shut down.",
