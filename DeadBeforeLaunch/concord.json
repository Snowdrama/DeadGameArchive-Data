    "notes": "Concord was a multiplayer hero shooter by Firewalk Studios. Firewalk started developing the game in 2018, and then was acquired by SIE in 2023. The game was shown off in the May 24th 2023 PlayStation Showcase, and a beta was released later in July. The game later released in 2024, and it was generally criricised for it's detailed but bland feeling characters, pretty yet uninspired visuals, and lack of features that set it apart from other hero shooters, while it was praised for it's well made shooting and reload animations, and that the gameplay was snappy and satifying. Ultimately the game was not a success and SIE pulled the game only a few weeks later, killing the game and closing the studio",
