PSO was a major success both in Japan and the US, getting multiple sequels and content updates, The game ran for 7 years before being shut down a few months after the launch of Phantasy Star Universe on the Xbox 360 and PS2. Being an MMO there's no official way to experience the game now that the servers are shut down.",
