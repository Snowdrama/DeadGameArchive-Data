    "notes": "The game was generally considered a success, and the game even spawned a sequel, however the controversy came in 2024 when the decision to shut down the servers for the game came as a shock to the community when they could no longer even play the Single Player campaign due to it being an always online game with no offline mode. The Crew's shutdown is the event that kickstarted the Stop Killing Games campaign.",
