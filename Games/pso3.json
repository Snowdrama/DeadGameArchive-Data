    "notes": "PSO Ep III is notable for being the sequel to the aclaimed PSO Episode I & II. Due to the game's shift in style from MMORPG to a card game didn't appeal to the fans of PSO, and the game had generally mixed reviews. Because of this the later released PSO Episode 4 Blue Burst that was released on PC, returned to the traditional gameplay.",
    "description": "A sequel to Phantasy Star Online Episodes I & II that has card based gameplay. The game had 2 different stories involving the government of the Pioneer 2 vs The Arkz an anti government faction. Reviews were critical as the Card gameplay didn't line up with player expectations."
