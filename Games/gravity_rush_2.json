    "notes": "The game is still playable offline, but there are several features of the online game that are missing, the biggest being Treasure Hunts a mini game where you take a photo of a treasure chest, and then that photo is then picked up by other players and they can use the photo to find the treasure. With the servers offline, many of the items offered by using the online mode are no longer available.",
