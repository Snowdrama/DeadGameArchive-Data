    "notes": "Wildstar was one of the most hyped new MMOs after the rise of World of Warcraft, and was a contender to be one of the 'WoW Killers' that would potentially take a chunk of WoW's userbase. However even with a positive reception, the game didn't end up taking off and a year after launch in 2015 it was announced the game would go free to play. In 2016 they shut down PvP and merged the remaining players into 2 PvE servers. Ultimately NCSoft closed Carbine Studios in mid 2018 with the WildStar servers to shut down shortly after in November the same year. Being an MMO there's no official way to experience the game now that the servers are shut down.",
